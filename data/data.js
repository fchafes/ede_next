      "Born and raised in Uruguay, Camila draws her initial inspiration from the serene landscapes and archaeological wonders of her hometown on the west coast. The simplicity and beauty of this small town continue to hold the deepest memories for her. Camila's early studies and works are grounded in traditional architecture and urbanism, shaping a solid foundation for her design principles and the mindful use of resources and materials in her creations.",
      "In contrast to this structured environment, Camila finds inspiration in the unbounded freedom of the underground music and arts scene. This unconventional influence enriches her latest work approaches, creating a harmonious blend of tradition and experimentation.",
      "In 2017, Camila founded Estudio del Espacio, aiming to bring together her more experimental works. Collaborations with dance companies, musicians, and diverse artists fueled her interest in interdisciplinary encounters, a theme that remains integral to the studio's philosophy. This desire for a more intimate dialogue has led to the creation of smaller-scale objects.",
      "In 2021, seeking new beginnings and self-expansion, Camila moved to Barcelona. This transition sparked a nostalgic connection to her roots in Uruguay, giving rise to the warm and captivating CLIMA series, inspired by the Uruguayan sky, which became the studio's first official collection.",
      "CLIMA's inaugural series was crafted in Uruguay, collaborating with the last acrylic factory in the country to develop specific colors, marking a poignant moment as the factory closed its doors in 2022. Since then, a commitment to ethical sourcing and collaboration with skilled artisans has become a cornerstone of Estudio del Espacio. The CLIMA series incorporates 3D printing alongside acrylic, allowing for production in both Europe and South America, with a keen focus on reducing the carbon footprint. The entire process, from 3D printing to assembly, takes place in the studio/workshop space.",
      "CLIMA is a testament to Camila's fascination with the celestial realm and the intersection of space and time. It serves as a tool for decompression and an avenue for freedom, with its atmospheric lights offering a gentle yet encompassing illumination, granting a sense of expansion to our earthly bodies. CLIMA invites us on a meditative journey, providing a subtle yet profound stimulation of the depths within us.",
      "Currently, Estudio del Espacio is actively engaged in creating new light pieces through collaborations with artists and experts in materials such as textiles and biomaterials. Simultaneously, Camila explores solo projects, investigating different forms and collaborating with craftspeople, allowing the fusion of Barcelona to intertwine with her South American roots. Estudio del Espacio aspires to be a platform translating life's perception into objects and spaces, fostering a dialogue between our external bodies and deeper beings.",
